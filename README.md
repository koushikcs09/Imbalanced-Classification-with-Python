#### Part I: Foundations
An imbalanced classification problem is an example of a classification problem where the distribution of examples across the known classes is biased or skewed.

Imbalanced classifications pose a challenge for predictive modeling as most of the machine learning algorithms used for classification were designed around the assumption of an equal number of examples for each class. This results in models that have poor predictive performance, specifically for the minority class. This is a problem because typically, the minority class is more important and therefore the problem is more sensitive to classification errors for the minority class than the majority class.
